This is a simple autochecker that just checks the whole MapFound.txt matches the expected output

Steps to run:
- Replace `PhaseC.py` with your assignment code but make sure it's named `PhaseC.py` OR you change the relative path in `autochecker.py`
- Run `autochecker.py`. Tip: use the ipython terminal like this for a better debugging output: `ipython autochecker.py`

By the way I've only confirmed that this works on mac
