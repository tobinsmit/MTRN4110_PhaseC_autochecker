Steps:
- Replace `PhaseC.py` with your assignment code but make sure it's named `PhaseC.py` OR you change the relative path in `automarker.py`
- Run `automarker.py` from the main folder `/automarker`. Use the ipython terminal like this for a better debugging output: `ipython automarker.py`

By the way I've only confirmed that this works on mac
